This is meant to be a simple application that calculates density alitute by various methods. More info to be provided as things are flushed out. But initial calculator will use
basic temperature and field elevation information to determine density altitude. 

Primarily this is used for aviation to help determine the performance of aircraft to be realistically expected given current airfield conditions.
